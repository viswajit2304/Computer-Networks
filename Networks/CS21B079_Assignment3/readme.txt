Activity2:
Source Code : Github , chatGPT, some part we discussed with our friends.
For this activity we have writen 3 pieces of code (sender , receiver , bash) for each protocol (SW,GBN,SR)
For getting the matrix values of each protocol, we just have to run the bash file for respective protocol and 
the Commands needed to run each bash file are given below :
SW : "python3 sawbash.py"
GBN : "python3 gbnbash.py"
SR : "python3 srbash.py"
After getting matrix values we pasted these values in graph.py code to get heatmaps for the corresponding graphs
Here we have used same color map but we adjusted the range according to the matrix for better visual understanding to these matrices separately.
Because when we use same range for all 3, the problem we are facing is that due to high values of SW protocol martrix the rest 2 are almost looking like monocromatic.
We are getting different output matrices for these codes each time, sometimes we got less values and sometimes higher values.

We have attached heatmap images for data in the matrices.

We used 400KBps bandwidth for all output matrices.
